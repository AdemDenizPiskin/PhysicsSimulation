# PhysicsSimulation
A group of python programs that simulate some physical phenomenon's such as gravity, springs and elastic collisions. I wrote those programs in my free time and 
they may not be very accurate or well optimized. Most simulations containt plots and animations. Below is a brief description of each program:

### Sim.py
Basically the main library where all the functions and classes are written. All other scripts use this file.

### Gravitation.py
Simulation of two massive objects attracted through gravity. Includes a simple animation.

### Single_spring.py
A basic animation and plot of a linear spring oscillating

### Double_Spring.py
A simulation of a nonlinear system with two-springs (ignoring the gravitational force).

### triple_spring.py
Three particles attached with springs to each other.

### Windy_Day.py
A particle getting drifted in the presence of some random wind.

### Leaf.py
A leaf getting blown in a windy day. The wind has friction force and a spring force attaching it to the tree. If it gets too far away it breaks.

### Two_body_collision.py
Two bodies making elastic collision

### random_particle.py
100 particles with random velocity and positions doing ellastic collision with one another. (The collision detector is not very well optimized).

### two_body_charges
Two electrically charged particles with ellastic collision. Gives some funny results when they get too close.
